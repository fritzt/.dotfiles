## Installation

Run:
`script/bootstrap`

This will create symlinks between your home directory and all files in these subdirectories listed as *.symlink.

Make sure that you add the path to this folder to your PATH. For instance, add the following line to your .bashrc template:
`export PATH="$PATH:$HOME/.dotfiles/bin"`

## Miscellaneous

The `bin` and `functions` folders contain some useful functions.
